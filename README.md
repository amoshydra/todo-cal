# Todo Calendar

> A tool that transform calender into a To-do planner

## Potential users
- Freelancers who would like to keep track of their working hours
- Users who would like to plan ahead of what they need to do
- Users who would like to have an overview of the things they need to do.

## Existing solution
**Google calendar** is a good place to allow users to use its calendar as a to-do planner. It allow user to quickly expand the duration of the calendar entry by pulling the edges, and allow user to quickly relocate the entryâ€™s timeslot.

However it is not designed for recording to-do at the calendar view. In such a case, it lack of functionality to hold unorganised tasks, managing completed task and many standard feature of an to-do app.

Most of the other existing app does not come with a calendar view that allow user to drag and drop tasks into the calendar. Or they are too complicated with too many features.

## Proposed Solution
A Todo app + a calender view, that allow users to quickly record down their todos and organise them easily.

## Usage flow:
1. List down all the tasks and to-dos
2. After all / most of the tasks has been written down, start organising the tasks into the calendar view.
